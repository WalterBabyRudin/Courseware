The Markov Chains course mainly focus on the performance analysis for which the Markov decision is made.

\subsection{News Vendor Problems}

A store sells perishable iterms (newpapers) with:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Selling price $c_p=1$
\item
Variable cost $c_v = 0.25$
\item
Salvage value $c_s=0$
\end{itemize}

The aim is to decide how many copies should be ordered. Before making the decision, we need to estimate the demand.

Suppose the demand $D$ has the following distribution:
\[
\begin{array}{llllll}
d&10&15&20&25&30
\\
\mathbb{P}&1/4&1/8&1/8&1/4&1/4
\end{array}
\]

Hence, the profit for the day $i$ is given by:
\[
\mbox{profit per day} = \min(q,D_i)c_p - qc_v,
\]
with $q$ being the number of copies ordered.

More generally, for $c_s\ne 0$, the profit for the day $i$ is
\[
\mbox{profit per day} = \min(q,D_i)c_p - qc_v+\max(q-D_i,0)c_s,
\]

Hence, our objective is to maximize the expected profit for a day
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
h(q)&=\mathbb{E}_D\mbox{Profit($q,D$)}\\
&=c_p\mathbb{E}_D\min(q,D) - c_vq+c_s\mathbb{E}_D\max(q-D,0)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
