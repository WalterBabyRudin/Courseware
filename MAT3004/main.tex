% Optional introduction:
%\begin{introduction}
%
%The word \textit {traffic} becomes \textit {teletraffic} in telecommunications, as communications becomes telecommunications to indicate technology use, e.g., conversation from some distance through phones or Internet. The term teletraffic covers all kinds of computer communication traffic and telecom traffic.  This book includes teletraffic loss models.
